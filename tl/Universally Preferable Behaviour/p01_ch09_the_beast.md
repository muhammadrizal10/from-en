## Ang halimaw

Ang isang layunin na pagsuri ng kasaysayan ng tao ay tila tumutukoy sa mabagsik na katotohanan na sa ngayon ang pinaka-mapanganib na bagay sa mundo ay *maling sistema ng etika*.

Kung titingnan natin ang etikal na sistema tulad ng komunismo, na responsable para sa mga pagpatay ng isang daang pitumpung milyong katao, malinaw nating makikita na ang tunay na panganib sa mga indibidwal ay hindi mga random na kriminal, ngunit *maling moral na mga teorya*. Sa katulad na paraan, ang Inkisisyon ng Espanyol ay hindi nakasalalay sa mga magnanakaw at pickpockets, kundi mga pari at tagataguyod na puno ng pagnanais na iligtas ang mga kaluluwa ng iba. Ang Nazismo ay umasa rin sa partikular na teoryang etikal hinggil sa kaugnayan ng indibidwal at ng kolektibo, at ang moral na pangangailangan upang maglingkod sa mga may kapangyarihan, pati na rin ang mga teoryang "nagpapatunay" sa likas na katangian ng lahi ng Aryan.

Sa paglipas ng panahon, sa buong kasaysayan ng tao, nakita natin na ang pinaka-mapanganib na mga instrumento sa mga kamay ng mga tao ay hindi mga baril, o mga bomba, o mga kutsilyo, o mga lason, ngunit sa halip *mga moral na teorya*. Mula sa "banal na karapatan ng mga hari" hanggang sa walang hanggan na lehitimo na paghahari ng mga modernong demokrasya, mula sa pagsamba sa ninuno ng ilang mga kultura ng Oriental sa modernong pagpapahintulot sa bansa-estado bilang personified ng isang lider sa pulitika, sa mga taong nangangako sa kanilang mga anak sa serbisyo ng partikular na mga ideolohiya sa relihiyon, malinaw na sa ngayon ang pinaka-mapanganib na kasangkapan na pagmamay-ari ng tao ay *moralidad*. Hindi tulad ng agham, na naglalarawan lamang kung ano ang, at kung ano ang magiging, ang mga teorya ng moral ay nagpapatupad ng isang malapit na walang silbi na impluwensiya sa mga puso at isipan ng mga tao sa pamamagitan ng pagsasabi sa kanila kung ano ang *nararapat*.

When our leaders ask for our obedience, it is never to themselves as *individuals*, they claim, but rather to “the good” in the abstract. JFK did not say: “Ask not what I can do for you, but rather what you can do for me...” Instead, he substituted the words “your country” for himself. Service to “the country” is considered a virtue – although the net beneficiaries of that service are always those who rule citizens by force. In the past (and sometimes even into the present), leaders identified themselves with God, rather than with geography, but the principle remains the same. For Communists, the abstract mechanism that justifies the power of the leaders is *class*; for fascists it is the *nation*; for Nazis it is the *race*; for democrats it is “the will of the people”; for priests it is “the will of God” and so on.

Ruling classes inevitably use ethical theories to justify their power for the simple reason that human beings have an implacable desire to act in accordance to what they believe to be “the good.” If service to the Fatherland can be defined as “the good,” then such service will inevitably be provided. If obedience to military superiors can be defined as “virtue” and “courage,” then such violent slavery will be endlessly praised and performed.

### Propaganda

The more false the moral theory is, the earlier that it must be inflicted upon children. We do not see the children of scientifically minded people being sent to “logic school” from the tender age of three or four onwards. We do not see the children of free market advocates being sent to “Capitalism Camp” when they are five years old. We do not see the children of philosophers being sent to a Rational Empiricism Theme Park in order to be indoctrinated into the value of trusting their own senses and using their own minds.

No, wherever ethical theories are corrupt, self-contradictory and destructive, they must be inflicted upon the helpless minds of dependent children. The Jesuits are credited with the proverb: “Give me a child until he is nine and he will be mine for life,” but that is only because the Jesuits were teaching superstitious and destructive lies. You could never imagine a modern scientist hungering to imprint his falsehoods on a newborn consciousness. Picture somebody like Richard Dawkins saying the above, just to see how ridiculous it would be.

Any ethicist, then, who focuses on mere criminality, rather than the institutional crimes supported by ethical theories, is missing the picture almost entirely, and serving mankind up to the slaughterhouse. A doctor who, in the middle of a universal and deadly plague, focused his entire efforts on communicating about the possible health consequences of being slightly overweight, would be considered rather deranged, and scarcely a reliable guide in medical matters. If your house is on fire, mulling over the colours you might want to paint your walls might well be considered a sub-optimal prioritisation.

Private criminals exist, of course, *but have almost no impact on our lives comparable to those who rule us on the basis of false moral theories*. Once, when I was eleven, another boy stole a few dollars from me. Another time, when I was twenty-six, I left my ATM card in a bank machine, and someone stole a few hundred dollars from my account.

On the other hand, I have had hundreds of thousands of dollars taken from me by force through the moral theory of “taxation is good.” I was forced to sit in the grim and brain-destroying mental gulags of public schools for fourteen years, based on the moral theory that “state education is a virtue.”[^12]

The boy (and the man) who stole my money doubtless used it for some personal pleasure or need. The government that steals my money, on the other hand, uses it to oppress the poor, to fund wars, to pay the rich, to borrow money and so impoverish my children – and to pay the salaries of those who steal from me.

If I were a doctor in the middle of a great city struck down by a terrible plague, and I discovered that that plague was being transmitted through the water pipes, what should my rational response be – if I claimed to truly care about the health of my fellow citizens?

Surely I should cry from the very rooftops that their drinking water was causing the plague. Surely I should take every measure possible to get people to understand the true source of the illness that struck them down.

Surely, in the knowledge of such universal and preventable poisoning, I should not waste my time arguing that the true danger you faced was the tiny possibility that some random individual might decide to poison you at some point in the future.

Thus, as a philosopher concerned with violence and immorality, should I focus on private criminals, or public criminals?

The violations that I experienced at the hands of private criminals fade to insignificance relative to even *one day* under the tender mercies of my “virtuous and good masters.”

If, then, the greatest dangers to mankind are false ethical theories, then our highest prioritisation should be the discovery, communication and refinement of a valid, rational, empirical and consistent ethical theory. If we discover that most plague victims are dying from impure water, then surely telling them to purify their water should be our first and highest priority.

Let us now turn to that task.

[^12]: Or, rather: “*forced* education is a virtue” – my parents were compelled to pay through taxes, and I was compelled to attend.
